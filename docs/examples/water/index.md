# Liquid Water

60 - 75 minutes
{: .label .label-blue }

## Summary

It should be no surprise that water is present in a significant fraction of disordered materials studies, owing to its importance to just about everything, and its presence just about everywhere! Here we'll set up, run, refine, and analyse the structure of liquid water at 298 K using three neutron scattering datasets measured on the SANDALS diffractometer at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source in 2001. This will illustrate most of the core workflows in Dissolve when applying it to the analysis of neutron scattering data, and is an excellent place to start if you're new to Dissolve and/or the analysis of disordered materials.

## Preparation

Download the example data `Dissolve-X.Y.Z-ExampleData.zip` or `Dissolve-X.Y.Z-ExampleData.tar.gz` (where `X.Y.Z` will be the current version) from the [continuous build](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/releases/tag/continuous) in the releases section on GitHub and unpack it if you haven't done so already.

> Open the Dissolve GUI
{: .action .action_dissolve}
> Choose **Empty Simulation** from the _Create_ section
{: .step}
> Save As...
{: .action .action_menu}
> Save your own input file under a sensible name in the `water` directory of the example data
{: .step}

Alternatively, download the data files listed below and save them to a location of your choice.
