**Dissolve** is a simulation tool for the interrogation of neutron scattering data, typically total neutron scattering data. It builds on the techniques established in the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) method by Soper.

**Dissolve** is in heavy ongoing development, and as such the code here is rather volatile. The [`develop`](https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/tree/develop) branch should always contain a compilable, working version however.

Executable installers for all major platforms can be found on the [https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/releases](releases page), including [https://github.com/trisyoungs/dissolve/releases/tag/continuous](continuous builds) from the latest source.

Various tutorial material and examples for **Dissolve** can be [https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve/examples/](found here).

Documentation is a work in progress, and is available at [https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve](https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve).
